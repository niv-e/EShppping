IRepositories
When designing the repositories, I choose returing Task<IEnumrable<T>> for small collection of data,
and Task<IAsyncEumbrable<T>> for larger data sets, that because  When you use IEnumerable,
all the data is loaded into memory at once.
This can lead to higher memory usage, especially with large data sets.
However, once the data is loaded, accessing the elements in memory is very fast.
hen you use IAsyncEnumerable, the data is streamed,
meaning that the elements are loaded into memory as you enumerate them.
This can lead to lower memory usage, especially with large data sets,
because not all the data needs to be in memory at once.
